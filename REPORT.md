## App Description

Our app is called GitChat, and it integrates with the Github API to
provide users a platform to talk with other Github users about
different repos. The goal of this app is to create better channels
of communication for people working on the same code, something that
is especially important during Covid-19. GitChat uses the WebRTC 
and PeerJS libraries that allow users to make voice calls with other 
people on the app. 

Since we wrote our proposal, we have had to scale down some of our
ideas in order to make the project more feasible to complete in the
time that we had. The main thing that changed was how
non-collaborators interact with calls on the platform. In the
proposal we described a queue system where someone who is not a
collaborator for a repo can join a call for that repo, and then join a
talking queue if they want to say something during the call. However,
we found that this was very difficult to implement. The call system is
now implemented so that collaborators can join and speak during a
call, and non collaborators can join a call but only to listen. A
user's collaborator status for a given repo is received from the
Github API. Our proposal also included an idea of flagging users who
were known to be trolls or create a negative experience on the app, 
which we did not end up implementing.

Users can interact with the application in a web browser. They can 
sign in using a pre-existing GitHub account and get redirected to a 
page showing a list of their repositories. Within each repository of 
which the user is a collaborator, they have the option to click a 
button to start a voice call within that repository. Other collaborators 
as well as non-collaborating users can join the call, but 
non-collaborators do not have the option to start calls or to speak 
during a call. The audio call gives the ability for collaborators to 
discuss the project in one place at the same time without having to 
respond individually to issues. It also gives non-collaborators to 
listen to the collaborators and their design process, approach to 
bug-fixes, future directions, etc.

This project contained more features than the other apps that we have
worked on during this class. With implementing the voice calls, Github
authorization, and friend feature, we combined what we learned in
class with new concepts we learned during the development of this app
over the past few weeks. Our app contains both a server built with
Elixir and Phoenix and a client built with React. Our server exposes
a JSON API that the client uses to get information about users, calls,
and history. The React app is a SPA that uses React-Router to simulate
different web pages. Gitchat implements secure login through Github,
and uses the Github authorization process to make authenticated
requests to the Github API for user and repository information.  

In order to store information about users and their history on
Gitchat, we created a Postgres database that stores users, their
friends, their starred repositories, and their call history. The
history allows users to quickly access the repos they have joined a
call on recently to jump on a call again with other collaborators. The
friends feature is integrated throughout Gitchat so that users can
have an insightful view of what their friends and colleagues are
working on. 

The neat feature that we chose to implement was the voice call
feature. When a user logs onto Gitchat, they can click on any of their
or their friends' repositories and join a voice call with other people
working on that repo or interested in hearing about it. We used
phoenix channels to implement this realtime functionality of joining a
voice call. 

The most complex part of our app is the calling functionality. We
decided to go with a peer-to-peer model for the call itself, and used 
Genservers and phoenix channels to manage which users are in the call. The
server keeps an object with each userâ€™s username and peer_id as well as
their role. When a new collaborator joins they are given information of
all the current members in the room. 

All the nodes on the channel are notified about the new
collaborator.  They then attempt to call the newly joined collaborator. If they
are a  collaborator themselves they also send in a mediastream of their
microphone.  The newly joined collaborator responds with their audio stream to
all the  callers. When a new user joins they also get the room
information. Everyone is informed of the new user so they can update their
display and the collaborators call the new user with their media stream.
This way we are able to maintain a network where connections between
collaborators are bidirectional, and one directional between users and
collaborators and non between users.  
  
Of course this sort of peer to peer solution is susceptible to
people  messing with their role locally, however the server maintains the
role of each user and all other nodes will not accept erroneous calls. 
We still think there might be ways people will be able to exploit the
system like for example passing in some audio file as the media stream, but
we could not come up with a good solution to this problem.   

One challenge that we faced throughout the development of this
project was testing, because the concept relies so heavily on there being
multiple users on the app. This is especially true for the friend feature,
and the live call feature. We were able to work around this by deploying
the app at different stages in the development process, however this was
a process that ended up taking a lot of time and slowing down the
whole development process.
